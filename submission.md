   > Computer Science                                                         <!-- response -->
   <!-- Place your response after the '>' ensuring you have at least one space after the '>' -->

1. Enumerate your top three favorite subjects in college:
   1. ComputerScience (duh)                                                        <!-- response -->

   <!-- An ordered list will automatically have the line numbers updated for you. -->
 
1. Provide a list of possible positions you would like to obtain after graduation.
   * Software Engineer                                                            <!-- response -->
   * Robotics Engineer                                                            <!-- response -->

  <!-- Feel free to add or remove additional response lines as needed. -->

#### Section Two
1. What is your primary reason for taking COMP122?
   > Obviously since I am a compsci major I'm sort of forced to take this class, but in all honesty, Computer Science interests me more than any other major, and this one assignment has made me feel more like a software engineer than anything in Comp 110. Installing git, messing with all the settings, setting up ssh and pushing my first commit was incredibly satisfying and I cannot wait for more. Also, I know about computers, but I wanted to know more about how they work, and I was always interested in machine code and computer architecture. All in all, I feel as though this class will teach me plenty of things I actually want to learn, and it has been a long time since I've been this excited for a class.                           <!-- response -->

1. What is the most important thing you want to get out of COMP122?
   > Valuable skills that I will need for the rest of my career as a software developer. Comp 110 was fun, and made me love Java and OOP in general, but it taught me nothing about file directories, machine code, or how to apply what we learned in real world scenarios. I want the experience most of all.                           <!-- response -->

1. What is your criteria for success for COMP122?
   > Success is really hard to measure when it comes to coding.           <!-- response -->
   > At first, I thought creating really neat and working code was all I needed to do, but its far more complicated than that.             <!-- response -->
   > Personally, I want to measure my success with the amount of experience I gather, and the relationships I form.            <!-- response -->
   > Also, I want to ask more questions, and want to communicate with my professors outside of just class hours.              <!-- response -->
   > Also also, good grades are pretty important, I guess.                                                               <!-- response -->
   >                                                                        <!-- response -->
   <!-- The above is an example of a multi-line response. -->
   <!-- Feel free to add or remove additional response lines as needed. -->

1. What one thing can I do to help ensure you are successful in this class?
   * From just this assignment, NOTHING! You provided us with so much information and clear criteria that this assignment was a blast to complete. I loved every bit of it. If anything, I really appreciate when a professor can give me honest advice, rather than trying to be friendly to avoid hurting my feelings, so be as mean as you can!                <!-- response -->
